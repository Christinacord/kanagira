Week 13
2/9-2/10: Presenter: Christina. Got the project. Started on documentations. First journal entry. No actual coding yet. Planned out our API Routes.

Week 14
2/13/23: Driver: Joe. Worked on authentication. Did not get too far, and we spent a good chunk of the time going through the Day 4 Exploration for Authentication.and troubleshooting Joe's issues on Windows.

2/14/23: Driver: Daniel. Finished setting up our authentication and database today. I drove for both early afternoon and early evening sessions. Docker_compose.yaml, gitattributes, authenticator, and the accounts.py for routers and queries, and pg-admin. Still struggling to understand the authentication. We did not get to test but we should have reached a point where we can just do testing tomorrow.

2/15/23: Driver: Ian. We had coded but not referenced anything against pg-admin or swagger yesterday. So we first started getting our volumes and migrations done. We then resolved some import issues and our docker-compose.yaml file. We then finished up our authentication/account testing. There were some errors, in our code that we spent a good chunk of time troubleshooting. Ended up with Riley and Sean troubleshooting. It turned out to be some errors in our code, mostly where we were referencing the wrong thing. Then we set up all of our migrations, so we would only have to migrate once. We had some troubleshooting to do again with our foreign key. Ryan had suggested what he knew from MySQL which was different from PostgreSQL just enough to be wrong. Riley helped us.

2/16/23: Driver: Ryan. We got to work on our Routes and Queries for our Boards, Swimlanes, and Issues. There was a good amount of thought we had to put into it as we went on since rather than duplicating over the same level, ours are nested within each other. Issues reference swim lanes which references boards. We got our post and get sorted out, we need to write out our put functions.

Week 15
2/21/23: Driver: Joe. We finished out a last hiccup with the post request and how we were calling in and setting up our models. Then we worked on our put requests. After some issues with and a mix up where we were actually creating and looking at the 200 response. We caught it when we getting the list and saw the multiples in there. With the put request done, our MVP is completed for the back end. We will come back for our stretch goals and complete the accounts model and add in deletes. But that will be done later.
