## 2/10/23

-Today we created our API endpoints and set up our project and group via GitLab. We edited and removed endpoints that we deemed unnecessary.

## 2/14/23

-I had a pip issue with some requirements that took up the majority of our time. We troubleshooted it as a group and found a solution which was deleting a conflicting version of Django on my PC. We started our Routes and Queries and began our CRUD routes.

## 2/16/23

-We continued with our routes and queries. We finished the majority of them for Boards, swimlanes, and issues. We got our posts and puts completed.

## 2/22/23

-We began work on our backend today. Christina, Ian, and myself were tasked with the HomePage. We got the body flushed out while we wait for the Nav to be complete. We will next add our Login/Signup buttons.

## 2/24/23

-/Today was a shorter day with a late start and social hack hour. I worked a little more on the homepage and researched MUI for a good portion of the day.

## 2/27/23

-We had some issues protecting our Boards page but got help from Candice on a solution. We cleaned up some dummy code and refactored the forms we had done.

## 2/28/23

-Christina and I worked on the Issue Creation form. After fixing the JSX as a group, we struggled figuring out how to call the board id and swimlane id. Candice suggested useParams and with her help and a ton of help from the almighty Justin, we were able to implement it successfully.

## 3/2/23

-We worked as a group today to solve some connection issues due to our pool.getconn line. With help from Riley, we found the error and made the proper changes to fix the issues. We added some backend to call the assignee name so help reference for our issues.

## 3/3/23

-Started the Boardview with Ian and Christina. Began Logic to set up the board and the swim lanes. Ran into issues with the auth but fixed them quickly. Ryan ended up taking over and implemented some math logic for the structure of the swim lanes.

## 3/6/23

-Today Myself, Christina, and Ian were working on the Issues Dashboard to view all assigned issues. We had some trouble fetching data but eventually figured it out with help from Ryan and Daniel. We fixed some formatting and pushed it.

## 3/7/23

-Fixed Issue modal to submit and display correctly. Created the Contact us page as well as the footer.
footer background color = 1976d2

## 3/8/23

-Today we worked on the drag and drop functionality of the issues. No success yet but we will continue to work on it. We decided against the footer for now since it was causing issues with the body and content of other pages. Christina and I also worked with Ian on the error handling for the Login and Signup pages.

## 3/9/23

-We wrote our unit tests today. Christina and I also worked on the issues view so that the view button would navigate to its assigned board.
We also made some minor changes to the issue form so that the int fields couldn't be negative and were min/maxed 1-5.

## 3/10/23

-Today we completed our documentation. We also went through all of the code and did a clean up and organized our files. We tested the app and walked through as a team to make sure everything was working properly. Great Success!
