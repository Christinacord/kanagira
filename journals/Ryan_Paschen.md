## 2/10/23

Created our project repository and created our API endpoints. Had long group discussion about what endpoints should and shouldn't exist for our MVP.

## 2/13/23

Presented our project idea and wireframe to the rest of the class. We also started on authentication together as a group. Decided that the entire backend would be done as a group.

## 2/14/23

Decided on and implemented PostgreSQL for our database and created most of our CRUD routes and queries. We also implemented PG-Admin to visualize our database.

## 2/15/23

Mostly spent the day reviewing SQL and creating all of the database tables that we need for our project. Also touched up on our entity models and fixed some issues with docker.

## 2/16/23

Added more queries and routers for our backend. Added GET and POST for boards/issues/swimlanes.

## 2/21/23

Completed all routes and queries along with authentication. Decided as a group we felt like we were done with the backend and that it was time to the move to the frontend. Also talked briefly about potentially splitting up into groups for the frontend development

## 2/22/23

Split up into groups to begin working on the frontend components. Daniel and I worked on the LoginForm component, while the others did some work on the home page.

## 3/6/23
Worked on some code over the weekend and implemented Material UI on a lot of pages. Daniel and I completed the Nav bar and the issue detail component.

## 3/7/23
Helped troubleshoot some issues with the issue modal displaying properly. Also worked with Joe to create the footer.

## 3/8/23
Collectively as a group we researched on ways to implement drag and drop functionality for the issues, but in order to save time and not miss deadlines, I split up from the rest of the group while they spent time researching, to develop buttons that would quickly move them from left to right.

## 3/9/23
Wrote our unit tests today, I wrote several of them, but then we forgot that we didn't protect our routes through the backend which broke the way authentication works in them so I scrapped most of them and just stuck to the GET requests ones that were easy to do. Plan on trying to write more the following week when I have more time.
